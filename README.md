## Introduction
A customer asks for some changes to his WordPress website which uses the default
TwentyTwenty theme. Please prepare proper file structure and implement all the changes listed
below:

### Task 1
There are some styling changes required, and there is a high chance that there will be a lot more
styling changes needed in the future. Where would you insert your custom CSS rules?

### Task 2
Load a custom JavaScript located in `assets/js/scripts.js` (file depends on jQuery and should be
loaded in the footer rather than header).

### Task 3
Write a code which will add custom post type “Books” with taxonomy “Genre”.
Custom post type must have slug “library” and translatable labels,
Taxonomy must have slug “book-genre” and translatable labels.

### Task 4
Create custom templates for:
4.1. Single Book page – displays Book title, image, book genre, date
4.2. Genre page (taxonomy) – displays list of Books from specific genre (5 books per page, please
implement pagination or simple links to show next/previous page)

### Task 5
Crate two shortcodes:
5.1. First one should return the title of most recent book.
5.2. Second one will return a list of 5 books from given Genre (user must be able to specify genre,
lets assume its just term ID). Returned books should be sorted alphabetically.

### Task 6 - Bonus
Create an AJAX callback returning 20 books in JSON format. JSON should only contain following
fields: name, date, genre, excerpt. You can use `scripts.js` file created previously in Task 2 to make
an AJAX call.

Good luck :)
